      // JS function declaration are allowed inside other functions
      // we did this in makePerson function in custom_objects section
      // An important detail of nested functions in JS is that they can access vars in their parent function's scope

      function parentFunc() {
        let a = 1;

        function nestedFunc() {
          let b = 4; // parentFunc can't use this
          return a + b;
        }

        return nestedFunc();
      } // returns 5

      // This can help us write more maintainable code
      // If a called function relies on one or two other functions that are not useful to any other part of your code
      // You can nest those utolity functions inside it
      // This keeps the number of functions that are in the global scope low, that's always a good thing

      // When writing complex code, it is often tempting to use global variables to share values between functions
      // This leads to unmaintainable code
      // Nested functions can share variables in their parent, so you can use that mechanism to couple functions togther
      // Use with caution
