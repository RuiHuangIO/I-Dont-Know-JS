      // Functions and objects are the core components of understanding JS
      // Here is the most basic function
      function add(x, y) {
        let total = x + y;
        return total;
      }
      // A JS function can take 0 or more named parameters
      // The function body can contain as many statements as you like
      // you can declare its own variables with are local to that funtion
      // RETURN statement can be used to return a value at any time, terminating the function
      // if no return statement is used or an empty return with no value is used, JS returns UNDEFINED

      // The named parameters are more like guidelines than anything else
      // you can call a function without passing the parameters it expects, and they will be set to undefined

      console.log(add()); // NaN, because you can't perform addition on undefined

      // you can also pass in more args than the function is expecting
      console.log(add(2, 3, 4)); // returns 2+3, 4 is ignored

      // within the function, it has access to the additional variables stored as arguments
      // it is an array-like object holding all of the values passed  to the function

      // here is the add function rewritten, let's write an average function
      function avg() {
        console.log(arguments);
        let sum = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
          sum += arguments[i];
        }
        return sum / arguments.length;
      }

      console.log(avg(2, 3, 4, 5));

      // To reduce the code, we can use the rest parameter syntax
      // This allows us to pass in any number of args into the function
      // it will include within that variable the entire list of uncaptured args that the function was called with
      // with the addition of a for...of loop, we can rewrite it as
      function avg2(...args) {
        let sum = 0;
        for (let value of args) {
          sum += value;
        }
        return sum / args.length;
      }
      console.log(avg2(2, 3, 4, 5));
      // In this code, the variable args holds all the values that was passed into the function
      // rest parameter will store all the args after its declaration, but not before
      // what if you wanna find the average of an array? you need to rewrite the function as
      function avgArray(arr) {
        let sum = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
          sum += arr[i];
        }
        return sum / arr.length;
      }

      console.log(avgArray([2, 3, 4, 5]));

      // What if we want to use the function we previsouly wrote?
      // JS lets you call a function with an arbitarty array of arguments, using the apply() method of any function object
      console.log(avg2.apply(null, [2, 3, 4, 5]));
      // 2nd arg to apply() is the array to use as rguments, the 1st will be discussed later on
      // you can also do this using the spread operator
      // avg2(...number)

      // JS lets you create anonymous functions
      let avg3 = function() {
        let sum = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
          sum += arguments[i];
        }
        return sum / arguments.length;
      };

      // avg3 and avg2 are sementically equivalent
      // you can put the function definition anywhere that you would put an expression
      // this enables a lot of clever tricks
      // like block scope in C

      let a = 1;
      let b = 2;

      (function() {
        let b = 3;
        a += b;
      })();

      console.log(a); // 4
      console.log(b); // 2

      // JS allows you to call functions recursively
      // This is useful for dealing with tree structures such as those fond in DOM

      function countChars(el) {
        if (el.nodeType == 3) {
          // TEXT_NODE
          return el.nodeValue.length;
        }
        let count = 0;
        for (let i = 0, child; (child = el.childNodes[i]); i++) {
          count += countChars(child);
        }
        return count;
      }

      // This highlights a potential problem with anonymous functions
      // how do you call them recursively without a name?
      // you can name function expressions for this
      // you can used named Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs)

      let charsInBody = (function counter(el) {
        if (el.nodeType == 3) {
          // TEXT_NODE
          return el.nodeValue.length;
        }
        let count = 0;
        for (let i = 0, child; (child = el.childNodes[i]); i++) {
          count += countChars(child);
        }
        return count;
      })(document.body);

      // The name provided to a function expression as above is only available to the function's own scope
      // This allows more optimizations to be done by the engine and results in more readable code
      // the name also shows up in the debugger and some stack traces, which can save you time when debugging

      // Note that JS functions are objects - like everything else in JS
      // you can add or change properties on them
