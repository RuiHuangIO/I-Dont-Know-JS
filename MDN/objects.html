      // JS Objects can be thought of as simple collections of name value paris
      // similar to dictionaries in Python, HashMaps in Java, Associative array in PHP (the three that I actually know)

      // since everything except core types is an object, any JS program involves a lot of hash table look up
      // the name part is a JS string, while the value can be any JS value type (includeing object)
      // this allows you to build data structure of arbitary complexity

      let obj = new Object();
      let obj2 = {};
      // these are the two ways to create an empty object
      // they are semantically equivalent.
      // ob2 is called a object literal syntax, a bit more convenient.
      // it is also the core of JSON format and should be preferred at all times

      // using object literal to initialize an object in its entirety
      let obj3 = {
        name: "carrot",
        _for: "Max", // 'for' is a reserved word, use '_for' instead.
        details: {
          color: "orange",
          size: 12
        }
      };

      // attribute access can be chained together
      console.log(obj3.details.color); // orange
      console.log(obj3["details"]["size"]); // 12

      // creating an object prototype 'Person' and an instance of that prototype, 'you'
      function Person(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
      }
      // define the object
      let you = new Person("You", 24);
      // we just created a new person called "you" aged 24

      // once created, an object's properties can again be accessed in one of two ways
      // 1st, dot notation
      let obj4 = {};
      obj4.name = "Simon";
      let name2 = obj4.name;

      // 2nd bracket notation
      let obj5 = {};

      obj5["name"] = "Simon2";
      let name3 = obj5["name"];
      // can use a varibale to define a key
      let user = prompt("what the key?");
      obj5["user"] = prompt("what the value?");

      // These two are also semantically equivalent
      // bracket notation has the advantage that the name of the propert is provided as a string
      // that means it can be calculated at run-time
      // disadvantage of this is some JS engine and minifier doesn't recogonize it
      // it can also be used to set and get properties with names that are reserved words
      let obj6 = {};
      obj6.for = "simon31"; // syntax error
      obj6["for"] = "simon32"; // gucci

      // starting in ES5, reserved words may be used as object property "in the buff"
      // similarly, in ES5, object keys can be defined by the variable using bracket notation upon being created
      // {[phontType]: 12345} is possible instead of
      // let userPhone = {}; userPhone[phoneType] = 12345;
