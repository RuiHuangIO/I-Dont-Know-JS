        strings in js are sequences of unicode chararcters
        localization is on the easier side
        to be more precise, they are sequences of UTF-16 code unit.
        Each code unit is represented by a 16-bit number
        Each Unicode character is represented by either 1 or 2 code unregisterModule

        To represent a single character, just use a string consist of that single character
      */

      console.log("haHAA".length); // 5
      // To find the length of a string (in code units)

      console.log("haHAA".charAt(0)); // "h"
      console.log("haHAA Kappa".replace("haHAA", "4Head")); // "4Head Kappa"
      console.log("haHAA".toUpperCase()); // "HAHAA"
      // you can use strings like objects too.
      // They have methods that allow you to manipulate the string and access info about import PropTypes from 'prop-types'
