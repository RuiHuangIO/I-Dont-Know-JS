      // This is one of the most powerful abstractions that JS has to offer
      // Also the most confusing to many
      function makeAdder(a) {
        return function(b) {
          return a + b;
        };
      }
      let x = makeAdder(5);
      let y = makeAdder(20);
      console.log(x(6)); // 11
      console.log(y(7)); // 27

      // This creates 'adder' functions
      // This function, when called with one arg, adds it to the arg it was create with

      // This is pretty much the same as inner functions
      // A function defined inside another function has access to the outer functions variables
      // The only difference is that the outer function has already returned
      // It is easy to assume the outer function's local variables no longer exist
      // BUT they do exist
      // moreover, there are two different 'copies' of makeAdder()'s local variables
      // one with a=5, one with a=20
      // therefore x(6)=11, y(7)=27

      // Here is the explanation
      // Whenever JS executes a function, a 'scope' object is created to hold the local variables created within that function
      // It is initialized by any variables passed in as function params
      // This is similar to the global object that all global variables and functions live in
      // but with a couple of differences
      // 1. a brand new scope object is created every time a function starts executing
      // 2. unlike global object (which is accessible as THIS, in browser as WINDOW),
      // These scope objects cannot be accessed from your JS code.

      // When makeAdder() is called, a scope object is created with one propert: a
      // a is the argument passed to the makeAdder() function
      // makeAdder function then returns a newly created function
      // Normally, JS's garbage collector would clean up the scope object created for makeAdder() at this point
      // But the returned function maintains a reference back to that scope object.
      // As a result, the scope object will not be garbage-collected until there are no more references to the function object that makeAdder() returned

      // Scope objects form a chain called scope chain, similar to prototype chain used by JS's object system

      // A closure is the combination of a function and the scope object in which it was created
      // It lets you save state, therefore they can often be used in place of objects
