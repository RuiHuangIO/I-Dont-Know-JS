    <p>
      JavaScript is a multi-paradigm, dynamic language with types and operators,
      standard built-in objects, and methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its syntax is based on the Java and C languages — many structures from
      those languages apply to JavaScript as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript supports object-oriented programming with object prototypes,
      instead of classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript also supports functional programming — functions are objects,
      giving functions the capacity to hold executable code and be passed around
      like any other object.
    </p>
    <ul>
      JS Types are:
      <li>Number</li>
      <li>String</li>
      <li>Boolean</li>
      <li>Function</li>
      <li>
        Object
        <ul>
          <li>Array (special kind of object)</li>
          <li>Function (Also special kind of object, technically speaking)</li>
          <p>(objects you get for free)</p>
          <li>Date</li>
          <li>Regex</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Symbol (new in ES6)</li>
      <li>undefined</li>
      <li>null</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are some built in error types as well, however, things are much
      easier if we simply this to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Number</li>
      <li>String</li>
      <li>Boolean</li>
      <li>Function</li>
      <li>Object</li>
      <li>Symbol</li>
    </ul>
