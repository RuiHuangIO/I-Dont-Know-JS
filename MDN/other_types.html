      // JS distinguishes between 'null' (a value that indicates a deliberate non-value and is only accessible through 'null' keyword)
      // and 'undefined' (a value of type undefined that inidicates a uninitialized value, aka a value that hasn't been assigned yet)
      // It is possible to declare variable without assigning a value to it in JS
      // This variable will be 'undefined' which is actually a constant

      // JS has a boolean type, with possible values 'true' and 'false', both of which are keywords
      // Any value can be converted to a boolean
      // 'false' (the value not the string), 0, empty strings (""), NaN, 'null' and 'undefined' all evaluate to 'false'
      // everything else is 'true'

      console.log(Boolean("")); // false
      console.log(Boolean(234)); // true
      // perform this conversion explicitly using Boolean() function

      // This is rarely necessary, as JS will automatically does this when a boolean is expected
      // An example of such is an if statement
      // Therefore, we can address some values as 'true values' or 'false values'
      // As they will return true or false when converted to boolean
      // another way of saying these are 'truthy' and 'falsy'

      // Boolean operations such as && (logical and), || (logical or), !(logical not) are supported as well
