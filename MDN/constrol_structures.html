      // JS has a similar set of control structures to other langs in the C fam
      // conditional statement are supported by if and else, they can be chained of course

      // JS has while loops and do-while loops
      // the first is good for basic looping
      // the second is for loops where you wish to ensure that the body of the loop is executed at least once

      // JS for loop is same in C and Java, you can provide control info on a single line
      for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        // will execute 5 times
      }

      // other for loops: for of loop

      // whether they will execute their 2nd operand depends on the 1st
      // this is useful for checking for null objects before accessing their attributes

      let name = o && o.getName();

      // or for caching values (when false values are invalid)
      let name2 = cachedName || (cachedName = getName());

      // JS has a ternary operator for conditional expressions

          doNothing();
      }

      // if a break statement is not added, execution will 'fall through' to the next level
      // if this is intended, it is usually a good idea to comment it

        case 1: // fall through
        case 2:
          eatIt();
          break;

      // the default clause is optional. You can have expressions in both the switch part and the cases if you like
      // comparisons take place between the two using the === operator
