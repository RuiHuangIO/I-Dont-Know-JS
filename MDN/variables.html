      // new variables are decared using one of three key words: let, const or var

      // let is available in the block
      let a;
      let name = "Rui";

      // i is not visible here
      for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        // i is visible here
      }
      // i is not visible here either

      // const are for variables that are never intended to change
      // cont is also available in the bock

      const Pi = 3.14; // set Pi
      Pi = 1; // This will throw an error because you can't change const

      // var is the most common keyword,
      // it doesn't have the restrictions as it was the only way to declare a variable traditionally
      // var is available in the function
      var b;
      var nameb = "Rui";

      // j is visible here
      for (var j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
        // j is visible here
      }
      // j is also visible here

      // if a variable is declared without assigning anything to it, its type is 'undefined'

      // import difference between JS and other languages like Java is that
      // in JS, blocks do not have scope, only functions do

      // In a compound statement (like an if statement for example), you would want to use let or const
      // so they are only available in the block
