// The function we pass in is a callback function
// The outer function that takes in the function (our callback) is a higher-order function
// HOF: Any function that can take in a function or pass out a function
// Just a term to describe these functions
// - any function that does it we call that -
// but there's nothing different about them inherently

// They simplify our code and keep it DRY
// they allow us to run async code
