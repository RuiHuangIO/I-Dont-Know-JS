      // Three dots are not just spread
      // it can also be used as rest params
      // ... can take one thing, unpacks it into multiple items
      // ... can also take multiple things and turn it into a single array
      // two use cases for rest param: first in a function, or in a destructuring situation

      function convertCurrency(rate, ...amounts) {
        console.log(rate, amounts);
        // amounts is an array with everything except 1.54

        return amounts.map(amount => amount * rate);
      }

      function convertCurrency2(rate, tax, tip, ...amounts) {
        console.log(rate, tax, tip, amounts);
        // now amounts is everything except rate, tax and tip
        return amounts.map(amount => amount * rate + tax + tip);
      }

      // supposely we run convertCurrency with a number of arguments
      const amounts = convertCurrency(1.54, 10, 23, 52, 1, 56);
      console.log(amounts);
      // you get an array with all the amounts converted

      // Destructuring example
      // lets assume we receive a data consisting of name, runnerId, distances
      const runner = ["Rui Huang", 123, 5.5, 5, 3, 6, 35];
      const [name, id, ...runs] = runner;
      // const [name, id, runs] = runner;
      // this will return Rui Huang 123 5.5
      // the rest of the args are ignored
      console.log(name, id, runs);

      // this data consists of cap, assistance, players
      const team = ["Rui", "Kait", "Lux", "Sheena", "Kelly"];
      const [captain, assistant, ...players] = team;
      console.log(captain, assistant, players);
